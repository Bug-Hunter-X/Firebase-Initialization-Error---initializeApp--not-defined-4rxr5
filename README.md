# Firebase Initialization Error
This repository demonstrates a common Firebase initialization error and its solution.
The error arises when the 'initializeApp' function from 'firebase/app' is not found, even after the correct import statement.
This can stem from incorrect import paths, version conflicts between Firebase packages, or issues with the project setup.  The solution demonstrates how to correct this with a verified import and appropriate package versioning.
